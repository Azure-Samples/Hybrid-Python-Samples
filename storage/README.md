# Hybrid-Python-Storage

This sample shows how to manage your storage account using Azure Python SDK. The Storage Resource Provider is a client library for working with the storage accounts in your Azure subscription. Using the client library, you can create a new storage account, read its properties, list all storage accounts in a given subscription or resource group, read and regenerate the storage account keys, and delete a storage account.
